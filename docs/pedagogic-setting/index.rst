Pedagogic setting
=================

The pedagogic principles for this course are based on my `teaching philosophy
<https://vknight.org/tch-phi/>`_. That web page includes a number of references
that dictate my evidence based practice which leads to the assumption that the
educators role is to empower and motivate learners to build their own
understanding of a subject.

The general pedagogic principles from my `teaching philosophy
<https://vknight.org/tch-phi/>`_ are further complemented by the subject
specific ideas of:

- The performance art notions of `<http://teachtogether.tech/en/>`_ which
  includes the use of live programming.
- PRIMM
  `<https://blogs.kcl.ac.uk/cser/2017/09/01/primm-a-structured-approach-to-teaching-programming/>`_
  which reduces cognitive load by allow students to gradually take ownership of
  code.

The setting for the course can be described as a flipped learning environment
with opportunities for individualised learning through assessment.

The main course content are all made available to the students with included
videos. There are two types of video for every concept:

- An overall concept: this is a non coding description of the concept.
- A live coding demo.

Following this, there are a number of exercises to let students self assess.
This flipped content ensures that contact time can be used in two separate ways:

1. A *pre* class: the goal here is to use live coding and PRIMM to introduce
   students to specific concepts. Students will undertake PRIMM type exercises
   in groups.
2. A *post* class: the goal here is to reflect on the lab sessions during which
   students get given feedback on their exercises. This will be done through
   PRIMM type exercises and peer instruction.

The later 3 weeks of the course are used for the purpose of individualised
learning. Students will work on a research project of their choice which
scaffolding and guidance allowing them to learn specific programming
techniques/tools for their chosen subject. The pedagogic rational here is to let
students take responsibility for their learning through self motivated
interests.

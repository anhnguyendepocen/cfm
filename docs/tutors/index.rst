For Tutors
==========

The role of lab tutors is vital to the success of this course.

Records for each student are to be kept on copies of :download:`record.pdf
<../_static/record/main.pdf>` which will be used in the final marking of their
coursework.

During each lab session, the :code:`record.pdf` document should assist with:

- Speak to each student; making a note of their attendance.
- During the first 6 weeks: assist where necessary.
- From week 7 onwards: engage in discussions to help scaffold progress of students'
  coursework.

Throughout: feedback specific and/or general difficulties to Vince Knight.

After week 10: return the filled in copies of :code:`record.pdf` to Vince Knight.

Guidance
--------

- With code queries: point students at section of notes where the answer is and
  then tell them what is needed.
- With writing queries: ask them relevant questions (refer them to marking
  criteria etc...).
- Make an effort to ensure you are fair and not advantaging a given student.
- Aim to be encouraging and enthusiastic.

Pre: Critically discuss some of the writing of the previous pieces
==================================================================

Objectives
----------

- Use peer review to discuss and better understand marking criteria for
  individual research project.

Notes
-----

5 mins: Discuss the marking criteria:

- Code (50%): This is all about demonstrating a good understanding of the code
  taught and also demonstrating the **learning/understanding** of a new coding
  concept. **This does not mean copying and pasting a completely different
  tutorial.**
- Content (25%): Demonstrating an actual good understanding of a specific topic.
  For example if you write a piece of work on computational numerical
  integration and makes errors this will lose marks. However, if you choose to
  write about Pythagoras's theorem and do a great job demonstrating
  understanding than that will gain you marks.
- Presentation (20%): Spelling and general writing but also clarity of
  mathematical discussion.
- Lab work (5%): How engaged you have been through the 11 weeks, preparation for
  labs etc...

5 mins: Ask students to form groups of 3 or 4. Decide on a piece of work to discuss.

5 mins: As individuals rate according to marking criteria.

10 mins: As a group discuss.

10 mins: As a class discuss together.

Repeat the above with another piece of work.

**Remind students that next time they should bring as complete a draft as
possible**.

    Subject: Lab session goal: writing of your report

    ---

    Dear students,

    The goal of the next lab session is to feedback on the writing of your
    report.

    Your lab tutor will aim to have a quick look at your writing to date and
    feedback on specific use of LaTeX as well as mathematical writing.

    For this to be as beneficial as possible, you should aim to have refreshed
    your LaTeX (see <>) and at the very least started your report.

    Thanks,
    Vince

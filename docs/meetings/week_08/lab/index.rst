    Subject: Lab session goal: feedback on your code

    ---

    Dear students,

    The goal of the next lab session is to feedback on your code.

    Your lab tutor will aim to have a quick look at the code you have written
    based on your conversation from the previous week. They will give you
    potential areas for improvement and possibly direct you towards other
    interesting aspects to consider.

    For this to be as beneficial as possible, you should aim to have written
    your code beforehand.

    Note that this is not a session to debug your code for you but if there is
    time after tutors have spoken to all all students they will possibly be able
    to assist you.

    Thanks,
    Vince

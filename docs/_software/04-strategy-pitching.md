## Strategy

As part of your strategy as a group the following things are to be considered:

- Project management (use of Gantt chart perhaps);
- Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT analysis);
- Consider dependencies of your project: in terms of code but also in terms of
  outside requirements.
